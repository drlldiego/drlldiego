## 🧠 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC).

I've been passionate about technology from a young age and always found it easy to explore and adapt to new tools, devices, and platforms. I'm especially interested in learning through experimentation, building meaningful projects, and solving real-world problems through code.

Outside of tech, I enjoy a wide range of creative and dynamic activities:  
🎭 I’m a student of an improv theatre group <strong>(Coimbra Impro)</strong>  
⚽ Co-founder and player of a 7-a-side amateur football team <strong>(Biro FC)</strong>  
🎸 Former rhythm guitarist in two Brazilian music groups, and a songwriter sometimes
🎾 Longtime tennis player (12+ years)  
✈️ Aviation fan and flight simulator enthusiast  
🌍 Travel lover with a curiosity for nature and culture
